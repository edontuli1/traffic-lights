# Introduction

Main goal of the project was to design a system that controls the flow of traffic on an intersection. The system is made of two different traffic lights for cars and one traffic light for pedestrian. The green light for cars stays on for five seconds and then turns orange for three seconds. Pedestrian light turns into walk light only when pedestrian press the button. Used seven LED lights to represent the three traffic lights. Center button as pedestrian button. Seven segment display to show the time left on particular light.
