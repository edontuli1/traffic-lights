# Introduction

The main goal of the project was to design a system that controls the flow of traffic at an intersection. The system is made of two different traffic lights for cars and one traffic light for pedestrians. The green light for cars stays on for five seconds and then turns orange for three seconds. Pedestrian light turns into walk light only when pedestrians press the button. Used seven LED lights to represent the three traffic lights. The center button is the pedestrian button. Seven-segment display to show the time left on a particular light.

To run the code on your FPGA, you can just download the files and run it.

Below is a Demo of the project working:
