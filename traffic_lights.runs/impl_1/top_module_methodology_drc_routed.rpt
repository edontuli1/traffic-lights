2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/count_one_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/count_one_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/count_one_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin L1/state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell L1/count_one[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) L1/count_one_reg[0]/PRE, L1/count_one_reg[1]/CLR, L1/count_one_reg[2]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch L2/led_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin L2/led_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 8 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
